## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Restore BCJ2 block framing and reject unconsumed input streams after decoding.

## 0.24.2 - 2026-10-30

### Fixed

- Reading an archive whose header declares streams info but no files info panicked. The reader
  rejects such a header with an error, as 7-Zip does.
- An empty entry between the files of a solid block hid the last file of that block from
  `for_each_entries`, `read_file` and `BlockDecoder`. The block covers all of its entries now.
- The writer wrote the `kEmptyFile` and `kAnti` bit vectors too short when entries without a
  stream followed the last empty file or anti item. Readers then lost the entry names or failed
  to open the archive. Both vectors now hold one bit for every entry without a stream.
- Decoding an archive with a block without packed streams panicked. The reader rejects such a
  block with an error.
- A closure of `for_each_entries` that left an entry of a solid block unread or partly read
  broke the later entries of that block. The reader now decodes and verifies the unread data
  before it hands out the next entry with data. Skipping such an entry costs its decoding, and
  an error in its data ends the iteration.
- A coder without exactly one output stream made `Block::get_unpack_size_for_coder` panic. The
  reader rejects such a coder with an error.
- A block with a very long chain of coders overflowed the stack, and a block with very many
  streams took quadratic time to open. The reader rejects a block with more than 64 coders or
  more than 64 input streams.
- Opening an archive whose header declares so many files, blocks or streams that their entries
  exceed the address space or the allocator aborted the process on 64-bit targets and panicked
  on 32-bit targets. The reader returns an error for such a header.
- A block whose bind pairs or packed streams used a stream twice made the decoder build the
  coders behind that stream once for every use. This could exhaust memory and abort the
  process. The reader rejects a block that uses a stream twice.
- The WASM `decompress` function panicked when an archive pointed past the end of its data,
  and on some reads from an input larger than 2 GiB. Its stream now limits seeks and reads to
  the data.
- Extracting an entry with a file time beyond the range of the platform's `SystemTime`
  panicked in the `decompress` functions on Windows. The extraction leaves such a time unset.
- Opening a source larger than 2 GiB whose start header declares a next header beyond the
  address space panicked on 32-bit targets. The reader returns an error for such a header.
- Opening an archive whose encoded header decodes to more data than its next header holds
  panicked on 32-bit targets and could abort the process on 64-bit targets. The reader returns
  an error when the decoded header exceeds the address space or the allocator.
- The name index of `ArchiveReader` for an archive with very many entries could exceed the
  address space and abort the process on 32-bit targets. The reader builds the index on the
  first `read_file` or `file_compression_methods` call and returns an error when it does not
  fit.
- Opening an archive with a very long entry name could exceed the address space and panic or
  abort the process on 32-bit targets. The reader returns an error when a name does not fit.
- Opening an archive with very many blocks or with large coder properties could exceed the
  address space and abort the process on 32-bit targets. The reader returns an error when they
  do not fit.
- Opening an archive with very many entries, blocks or streams could abort the process on
  32-bit targets when a bit field of the header, such as the CRC, empty stream, time or
  attribute flags, did not fit in the address space. The reader returns an error when it does
  not fit.
- Opening an archive with entry names could abort the process when the allocator refused the
  buffer for the names. The reader returns an error in that case.
- Opening a malformed archive could abort the process when memory ran out before the reader
  formatted its error message. The reader creates its header parsing errors without
  allocation. The external flag of a time or attribute property now returns
  `Error::ExternalUnsupported`.
- Decoding a PPMd coder could abort the process when the allocator refused its model memory
  and no memory was left for the error message. The decoder creates its PPMd errors without
  allocation.
- Decoding a coder with an unknown or unsupported compression method could abort the process
  when memory ran out before the decoder named the method or its id in its error. The decoder
  allocates this text with fallible allocation and leaves it empty when memory is exhausted.
- Decoding a block with too many coders or with an unsupported coder with several inputs could
  abort the process when memory ran out before the decoder formatted its error message. The
  decoder creates these errors without allocation.

## 0.24.1 - 2026-10-18

### Changed

- Bumped `lzma-rust2` to 0.23.

### Fixed

- Fix decoding large files under 32-bit systems.

## 0.24.0 - 2026-10-11

### Changed

- Bumped `lzma-rust2` to 0.22.

### Added

- `ArchiveWriter::push_raw_block`, which copies a block of an existing archive into the one being
  written without decoding it, under new entry names. Renaming an entry, dropping one, or adding
  to an archive no longer means re-encoding the rest of it.

### Fixed

- Writing packed streams of which only some have a CRC wrote which ones did, but not their CRCs,
  leaving an archive neither this crate nor 7-Zip could open. A CRC of 0 was also taken for a
  missing one.

## 0.23.0 - 2026-09-18

### Changed

- Bumped `zstd` to 0.14.
- Bumped `lzma-rust2` to 0.21.

### Added

- `LzmaOptions::set_nice_len`, `LzmaOptions::set_dictionary_size` and `Lzma2Options::set_nice_len`.
- `EncoderConfiguration` can be built from `LzmaOptions` with `into()`.

### Fixed

- PPMd compression now produces archives accepted by 7-Zip and reports output errors when finalizing encrypted entries.
- Reject unsupported LZMA and LZMA2 encoder dictionary sizes with an error before allocating the encoder or starting
  compression workers, avoiding capacity-overflow panics.
- Improved decompression performance for non-solid 7z archives containing many files.

## 0.22.2 - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Fixed build process and tests for all cargo feature combinations (#126)

## 0.22.1 - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Fixed memory check on 32-bit systems when using PPMd (#134)

## 0.22.0 - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- Bumped `lzma_rust2` to 0.20.
- Expose coder's properties (#131, thanks @lukr54)
- Let a solid pack be compressed away from the writer (#132, thanks @lukr54)

## 0.21.5 - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Bumped `lzma_rust2` to 0.19.
- Batch AES-CBC decryption to improve performance.

## 0.21.4 - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Fixed an integer overflow when summing attacker-controlled coder stream counts while parsing a block header. Malformed
  archives panicked in debug builds and bypassed the stream-count bound in release builds. They are now rejected with an
  error. (#127, thanks @tyrex-vberthier)

## 0.21.3 - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- Cache most recent AES key derivation to improve performance (#118, thanks @jdlien)

### Fixed

- Hardened the library against malicious or malformed archives that could otherwise cause a panic, an infinite loop, or
  an unbounded allocation while parsing or decoding.

## 0.21.2 - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Decode 7z folders that layer a single-input filter (e.g. Delta) on top of a BCJ2 coder (`Method = Delta BCJ2`). These
  folders previously failed to decode with an
  `Unsupported method` error because the decoder required the folder's final output coder to be BCJ2 itself. (#117,
  thanks @trevorWieland)

## 0.21.1 - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Fix security issue were malicious 7z files could write files outside the destination directory. Reported by @lintowe
  (#116)

## 0.21.0 - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- Bumped MSRV to 1.93 (required by `nt-time` 0.15)

### Updated

- Bumped `nt-time` to 0.15 (#105)
- Bumped `aes` to 0.9 and `cbc` to 0.2 (cipher 0.5) (#111, #110)

### Fixed

- `K_ANTI` property block was not written for archives containing only anti-items, so anti-items were extracted as
  0-byte files instead of acting as deletion markers (#112, thanks @uraf)
- `compress_path` no longer emits a spurious entry for the root directory itself when compressing a directory tree (#79,
  thanks @super1207)

## 0.20.2 - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- Updated internal dependencies `lzma-rust2` to v0.16 and `getrandom` to v0.4

## 0.20.1 - 2026-01-01

### Fixed

- Fix bug where small headers of encrypted files were not encrypted (#98)

## 0.20.0 - 2025-12-07

### Changed

- Expose public getters for streaming archive data @vihu (#93)

### Fixed

- Brotli codec decompression is not working without compress (#95)

## 0.19.4 - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

- Fixed "AES256 properties too short" bug (#91)

## 0.19.3 - 2025-11-01

### Updated

- Target ppmd-rust v1. Since ppmd-rust is stable and has a major version, we will target it directly to reduce
  maintenance burden.

## 0.19.2 - 2025-10-29

### Updated

- Target lzma-rust2 v0.15.

## 0.19.1 - 2025-09-23

### Fixed

- Removed too strict debug_assert as reported in #81
- Removed incompatibility issues when using the `ArchiveWriter::push_source_path()` with single files. We now properly
  handle both cases were a file or a directory is given to the function.

## 0.19.0 - 2025-09-20

### Changed

- Breaking change: Rename identifiers to follow Rust API Guidelines @sorairolake (#59)

### Updated

- Target lzma-rust2 v0.14.
- Updated the documentation to include the BCJ2 codec again. It was never gone, only overlooked.

### Fixed

- Improved compatibility with third party utilities when creating 7z files (esp. Windows's Explorer and macOS's Finder).
- Improve docs.rs feature compatibility @sorairolake (#56)

### Removed

- Removed the dependency to `byteorder`.

## 0.18.0 - 2025-08-25

### Added

- Add support for BCJ IA64 filter.
- Add support for BCJ RISC-V filter.
- Added encoder support for all BCJ filter.

### Updated

- Target lzma-rust2 v0.10.

### Changed

## 0.17.1 - 2025-07-26

### Updated

- Target lzma-rust2 v0.6.

## 0.17.0 - 2025-07-25

### Added

- Added muti-threading support for LZMA2 compression & decompression.
- Added `ArchiveReader::set_thread_count()` to set the thread count when decoding with multiple threads. Only LZMA2 is
  supported right now. `ArchiveReader` will set the thread_count with the help of
  `std::thread::available_parallelism` as default.
- Added missing documentation for the public API.

### Changed

- Split `LZMA2Option` into `LZMAOptions` and `LZMA2Options` to better support multi-threading encoding for LZMA2.
- Removed `EncoderOptions::Num` enum, which means encoders needs to be configured with their respected option struct.

## 0.16.2 - 2025-07-16

### Updated

- Target lzma-rust2 v0.4 which increases the encoding speed.

## 0.16.1 - 2025-07-12

### Updated

- Target lzma-rust2 v0.3 which increases the decoding speed dramatically (around 50% on x86_64).

## 0.16.0 - 2025-07-04

### Changed

- Removed a lot of exports that were not used in the public facing API.
- Expose all compression and filter method options via the `encoder_options` module.
- Renamed the following structs in an attempt to make the API easier to navigate:
    - `SevenZArchiveEntry` -> `ArchiveEntry`
    - `SevenZReader` -> `ArchiveReader`
    - `SevenZWriter` -> `ArchiveWriter`
    - `SevenZMethod` -> `EncoderMethod`
    - `SevenZMethodConfiguration` -> `EncoderConfiguration`
    - `MethodOptions` -> `EncoderOptions`
    - `Folder` -> `Block`
- Renamed all instances of "folder" in the API to "directory" instead to clearly distinct from the "folder" in the 7z
  format specification and align with the std fs module.
- Internal `Archive`, `SteamMap`, `Coder` and `Block` fields are removed from the public API.
- What the 7z specification calls "folders" are a false friend and we instead call them "blocks".
- Every API that takes a password now uses the `Password` struct instead. Added helper functions to create password from
  strings and raw bytes.
- The needed features for WASM changed. Please use the "default_wasm" feature.
- Removed the hard dependency to `nt-time` by creating our own time struct `NtTime`. The feature can be used to convert
  to and from `nt-time::FileTime`.

### Removed

- Removed the dependency to `bit-set` and `filetime_creation`.
- `nt-time` dependency is now optional.

### Updated

- PPMd crate to version v1.2, which fixes the compatibility issues with existing 7z files using PPMd7.

## 0.15.3 - 2025-06-28

### Fixed

- Properly finish PPMd files.

## 0.15.2 - 2025-06-27

### Fixed

- No functional updates.
- Moved lzma-rust2 and ppmd-rust into their own crates.

## 0.15.1 - 2025-06-22

### Fixed

- Updated outdated documentation.

## 0.15.0 - 2025-06-22

### Updated

- Target optional dependency bzip2 v0.6.

### Changed

- The PPMd crate is using a native Rust version that is validated with Miri. All 7zip supported compression algorithms
  (LZMA, LZMA2, BZIP2 and PPMd) have now Rust native implementations and don't need a C compiler.
- All standard compression algorithms of 7zip are enabled by default.
- Use default feature of lz4_flex

## 0.14.1 - 2025-06-02

### Added

- Added support for ARM64 BCJ filter (by Benkol003).
- Add support for encoding LZ4 with skippable frames.

### Fixed

- Fixed decompressing LZ4 that contain skippable frames.

### Changed

- Use lz4_flex instead of lz4, which is a faster Rust native implementation. The only downside is, that only one
  compression level is supported.

## 0.13.2 - 2025-05-01

### Fixed

- Loose version restrictions on some dependencies.

## 0.13.1 - 2025-04-05

### Fixed

- Fix broken WASM build.

## 0.13.0 - 2025-03-31

### Fixed

- Fix the bug where the optional compression methods did not finish properly and created invalid entries when writing 7z
  archives.

### Changed

- Moved `CountingWriter` from lzma to sevenz crate, since it was an internal implementation detail of the sevenz crate.
- Remove implicit way to call `finish()` by `calling write(&[])` on the lzma and lzma2 writer. This was again an
  implementation detail of the sevenz. `finish()` now also takes `self`, like other compression libraries.

### Added

- `LZMAWriter` and `LZMA2Writer` now expose the inner writer and also return it when calling `finish(self)`.

## 0.12.1 - 2025-03-10

### Fixed

- Fix broken LZ4 feature compilation

## 0.12.0 - 2025-02-28

### Added

## 0.11.0 - 2025-02-26

### Updated

- Updated dependency nt-time to 0.11

### Changed

- Introduced a new feature "util", so that users can deactivate those functionality, if not needed
- Added a lot of documentation tags for docs.rs
- Update of nt-time introduce the need to increase MSRV to 1.85

## 0.10.0 - 2025-02-26

### Changed

- The Brotli codec now supports the skippable frame encoding found in zstdmt (used by 7zip ZS and NanaZip). This is the
  default format, since it seems to be the default for user facing programs. The default data a frame contains is 128
  KiB.

## 0.9.0 - 2025-02-25

### Added

- Add `SevenZReader::file_compression_methods()`.

### Fixed

- Improve compatibility with third party programs (tested with 7-Zip ZS 1.5.6)
  bzip2, LZ4 and ZSTD now work flawless. BROTLI isn't compatible right now.

## 0.8.0 - 2025-02-25

### Added

- Optional support for compressing / decompressing with BROTLI
- Optional support for compressing with bzip2
- Optional support for compressing / decompressing with DEFLATE
